                    A style guide helps create a consistent <em>Brand Image</em>.
                    Our website, posters, flyers, handouts, etc. should all represent
                    BTCRIT in a predictable manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, there is no rule saying to use this. To be honest,
                    I built this purely to help the design process for WebsiteV2.
                    If our poster designers and others choose to follow this, I'll
                    consider it a bonus.

                <!-- Logo svg: Hamster -->
                <h2>Logo</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, for now, temporarily, for the time being, our
                    logo is the BTCRIT Hamster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The logo is 200px by 200px, though due to its SVG nature, it
                    can be scaled to any size. Below 64px, detail is lost - at
                    small sizes, a square of accent color is preffered. Around
                    the Logo, at least 1rem of space is preffered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Appropriate backgrounds include Dark, DarkGray, and Base.
                    Accent and lighter colors provide too little contrast to
                    be suitable. See the
                    <a class="intextlink" href="#color">

                <p>
                    The main color of the logo was extracted as the Accent color.
                    From there, Base was chosen such that Accent would
                    complement it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dark and Light are standard colors. When Base is overlayed
                    on Dark and Light with low opacity, the result is Darkgray
                    and Gray. Lightgray is a slightly darker Light, useful for
                    backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Base is a general root color, from which all others arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Light is very close to white. Light causes items to 'pop' off
                    of a LightGray background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LightGray is very neutral, and is ideal for large backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gray has influences from Base, and is good for highlighting
                    small sections, or sinking an area away from LightGray.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DarkGray is just kinda here, I don't really have a specific
                    use for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dark is my favorite shade of gray. It's roughly off-black,
                    making it a suitable background and font color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accent is more powerful the less it is used. Accent is best
                    used on link hover events and borders on important things.

                <p>
                    For block text, Open Sans 400 was chosen. Serif fonts have
                    lots of small details distinguishing letters. In print,
                    these small details make reading easier. On screens however,
                    serifs are lost into anti-aliasing noise, making Sans-Serif
                    fonts appear cleaner and easier to read.

                    <b>REM</b> units should be used in most cases, as they are
                    consistent accross elements. <b>EM</b> units should be used
                    for spacing that changes with element font size, such as the
                    <span class="code">line-height</span> property.
